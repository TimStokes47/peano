       * Peano's task fusion pattern requires transparent tasks. An explanation
       * of this can be found in @ref tarch::multicore. Just scroll down to the
       * caption "Task execution patterns and orchestration" in the detailed
       * description.
       *
       * OpenMP supports transparent tasks with version 6. Peano therefore
       * has an internal helper routine tarch::multicore::omp::majorOpenMPVersion(),
       * through which we can check if this major version is already supported.
       * Depending on the OpenMP version, we can either directly map our task
       * graphs onto tasks, or we have to work around the whole transparency
       * thing. No matter if we have OpenMP 6 or not, the fundamental idea of
       * how we map Peano's task numbers, which are all integers, onto OpenMP
       * task dependencies.
       *
       *
       * # Task dependencies: mapping integer task numbers onto addresses
       *
       * Dependency tracking in OpenMP is organised via addresses. These
       * addresses are sole helpers, i.e. the underlying memory region doesn't
       * hold any data with semantics. However, it has to be owned by the
       * application code. To ensure this is the case, we allocate some chunk
       * only for the dependency tracking and hold its baseline address in a
       * variable dependencyTrackingBaseAddress.
       *
       * The initial default size of this memory tracking is specified by
       * DefaultSizeOfMemoryRegionUsedForDependencyTracking. This is implicitly
       * the highest task number that we can handle. However, if the code
       * requests a higher number, then we pause and grow the memory region
       * before we continue.
       *
       * We maintain two integers, sizeOfMemoryRegionUsedForDependencyTracking
       * and maxSizeOfMemoryRegionUsedForDependencyTracking, to always keep
       * track how big the memory is.
       *
       *
       * ## Lesson learned: Not handling tasks
       *
       * I originally thought that we could refrain from always immediately
       * growing this memory dependency region. We could, in theory, look up
       * if we can handle a dependency (we do that anyway) and then execute
       * tasks immediately if we cannot map them onto an OpenMP dependency as
       * we don't have the memory reserved yet.
       *
       * Is a bad idea. The task fusion relies on working taskwaits to yield
       * correct results. That is, if a thread issues a taskwait on a specific
       * task, it has to trust the OpenMP layer that this task actually has
       * terminated. If the task is currently executed immediately by another
       * thread, as we don't have dependency memory, there's no way for the
       * taskwait to actually wait for the task to terminate. All tasks are
       * therefore mapped onto actual tasks as a matter of principle.
       *
       * If we don't have the memory to administer a task, we have to grow
       * it before we continue handling it. The process how to handle a new
       * task thus is always the same:
       *
       * - Invoke @ref tarch::multicore::omp::internal::reserveDependencyTrackingMemory()
       *   to ensure that memory is available to handle a task number.
       * - For all dependencies that we handle, check with @ref tarch::multicore::omp::internal::canServeDependencyEntry()
       *   if these had been mapped onto proper tasks before. If not, we can
       *   just ignore these dependencies (this also holds for task waits).
       * - Check via tarch::multicore::omp::majorOpenMPVersion() if we can
       *   map a task onto a transparent task or need to do all depencency
       *   tracking manually.
       *
       * You find this pattern in @ref tarch::multicore::native::spawnTask()
       * for example.
       *
       *
       * ## Tasks in OpenMP before version 5
       *
       * If we have OpenMP 5 or earlier, we don't have transparent tasks, so
       * have to provide a workaround. What we do it that we do not only
       * allocate some memory for dependency tracking, we also set each entry
       * to one of the following values:
       *
       * - TaskNumberNotUsedYet
       * - TaskNumberSpawned
       * - TaskNumberRunning
       * - TaskNumberTerminated
       *
       * Task waits are then realised through atomics and polling over these
       * variables.

         * Addresses that represent dependencies in OpenMP have to correspond to
         * allocated, user-owned memory. To ensure this is the case, I hold one
         * big memory block for all the dependencies.
         *
         * Unfortunately, I do not know how big this memory block has to be. So I
         * use any check if an out condition can be served as an
         * opportunity to grow the memory region which arises always if
         * there are no more tasks pending that might use the dependency tracking.
         * This happens in shouldGrowDependencyMemory().
         *
         * ## Thread safety
         *
         * No new tasks with dependencies can not be spawned while I grow the memory
         * region. This means we need a critical section in the routine around this
         * one: multiple threads can read, but if one decides to write, no other
         * thread should do anything related.
         *
         * ## Dependencies
         *
         * I originally had this idea that each task could increment/decrement a
         * counter, so I can check if tasks are still pending. If so, I'd increment.
         * But this does not work: If a task decrements the counter and signals
         * "I'm done", OpenMP might not have tidied up the underlying memory region.
         * So if I now free the memory (as I think no tasks are there anymore), this
         * might happen at exactly the point in time where OpenMP still updates its
         * out-dependencies. Therefore I loop over all potential in-dependencies
         * (many of them will be antidependencies) to ensure that OpenMP really has
         * done all of its work. A simple wait will btw not work: It only works on
         * directly children.
         *
         * ## Remark
         *
         * At this point, I do not use the routine. For some applications, it might
         * be reasonable to invoke it, but it has to happen outside.

         * With OpenMP 6, we get transparent tasking. That is, we can have tasks with
         * dependencies which are not sibling tasks. Therefore, we can directly map
         * all dependencies on memory references in dependencyTrackingBaseAddress.
         *
         *
         * ## Assumptions
         *
         * This routine makes a couple of assumptions:
         *
         * - The caller has already incremented numberOfPendingTasks by one;
         * - The dependencyTrackingBaseAddress array hosts all indices specified
         *   within inDependencies and outDependency;
         * - The semaphore dependencyTrackingSemaphore is locked with a read lock.
         *
         *
         * ## OpenMP < 6 and the GNU compiler
         *
         * If we use an "older" version of OpenMP, then the transparent keyword is
         * not supported. That means, the pragma with a transparent will create a
         * translation error or at least a warning. I therefore tried to embed the
         * function into a
         *
         * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
         * if constexpr( tarch::multicore::omp::majorOpenMPVersion()>=6 ) {
         *    ...
         * }
         * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
         *
         * section. Unfortunately, this does not help. C++ might ignore the if
         * branch, but the standard also says that the loop body has to be
         * syntactically correct, which is kind of violated. So you'll still
         * get a translation error/warning for this code if you use older
         * OpenMP versions.
         *
         * I therefore decided to remove the if and work with the direct
         * OpenMP version pragma. Please note that this is only required for
         * GCC. With LLVM, it would just ignore the unknown transparent.
         *
         *
         * @param inDependencies Sequence of task numbers which can be empty. We need
         *  a vector here (even if the udnerlying type is a set), as we use OpenMP's
         *  iterator.
         *
         * @param outDependency Is either empty or contains exactly one element. As
         *  we use a vector, we can work with OpenMP's iterator supporting both an
         *  outgoing dependency and no dependencies at all.

        /**
         * Variant of spawn for all OpenMP versions under 6
         *
         * The name is slightly misleading, as we support any OpenMP version
         * between 3.x and 5 here. The routine is very similar to the version
         * 6, but this time we keep track of the tasks manually.
         *
         * We manually keep track in a map what the status of a task is. This
         * has a couple of serious implications:
         *
         * 1. A task might start even though it is not ready yet. That means,
         *    we have to manually check once we are fired up if we are really
         *    ready. The reason why a task is starting "prematurely" is that
         *    we cannot use transparent tasks, i.e. a neighbour non-sibling
         *    task might have spawned the task and we might fire up even though
         *    we are not ready yet.
         * 2. We cannot handle self-dependencies, i.e. in-out ones. If we spot
         *    an in-out dependency, we remove it from inDependencies (therefore
         *    it is not const), wait manually for our predecessor task to
         *    terminate by polling the status, and then we carry on. The manual
         *    wait is important, as we will overwrite the status with pending
         *    immediately after.
         *
         * As we do all of our dependency management manually, we don't have to
         * rely on any OpenMP dependencies at all. But it might actually make
         * sense to employ them too (see remarks below).
         *
         *
         * ## Assumptions
         *
         * This routine makes a couple of assumptions:
         *
         * - The caller has already incremented numberOfPendingTasks by one;
         * - The dependencyTrackingBaseAddress array hosts all indices specified
         *   within inDependencies and outDependency;
         * - The semaphore dependencyTrackingSemaphore is locked with a read lock.
         * 
         *
         * ## Issues we found
         *
         * It is possible that many threads spawn tasks at the same time that have
         * to wait for other tasks that are currently stored in the ready queue.
         * As we poll the ready queue state, this can lead to starvation.
         *
         * To avoid this we add a taskyield if an
         * in-dependency isn't ready. This moves the thread onto a different task,
         * so it will eventually end up with one that is ready to process. This
         * can also occur in waitForTasks(...), and the problem is dealt with in the
         * same way. 
         *
         *
         * ## Implementation decision
         *
         * Modelling the out dependencies as vector is not particularly elegant.
         * As each task as at most one out dependency (its "number"), we could
         * have worked with an integer making one particular value, e.g. -1,
         * mean "no dependency". As I work with a vector however, I can use
         * OpenMP's iterators.
         *
         *
         * ## Flaws and known issues
         *
         * Logically, there is no need for the spawned task to have any
         * dependencies, as all dependency management is done manually through
         * polling. This is not very elegant. Indeed, I'm afraid that it can
         * lead to starvation. Therefore, I would like to use dependencies.
         * If the lack of transparent dependencies leads to antidependencies,
         * i.e. tasks start prematurely, I don't care, as we still have the
         * manual handling.
         *
         * If the dependency management works however, the task runtime ensures
         * that we do not stress the system through polling too much.
         * Therefore, I originally had this splendid idea to use
         *
         * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
         * #pragma omp task priority(job->getPriority()) depend(iterator(j=0:inDependencies.size()), in: dependencyTrackingMemory[inDependencies[j]]) depend(iterator(j=0:outDependency.size()), out: dependencyTrackingMemory[outDependency[j]]) shared(numberOfPendingTasks) untied
         * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
         *
         * for the tasks. However, this made the code crash in the OpenMP
         * runtime non-deterministically.
         *
         * @see tarch::multicore::omp::internal::hasTaskFinishedInOpenMP5() as counterpart how to
         *   manually wait for tasks.
         *
         * @param job Pointer to the actual task. Is never a nullptr.
         * @param inDependencies Number of in-dependencies. All of these
         *   indices can be served by the underlying memory region. Set might
         *   be empty.
         * @param outDependency Out-dependency which is either an empty set
         *   meaning that there is no out-dependency and noone will ever wait
         *   for this specific task, or it holds exactly one number.
