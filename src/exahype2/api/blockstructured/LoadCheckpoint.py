class LoadCheckpoint(Solver.GridConstruction):
    """!

    Set up a simulation from a checkpoint

    Alternative to the setups over a regular grid
    (@ref exahype2.api.fv.SetupSimulationOverRegularGrid,
    @ref exahype2.api.rkfd4.SetupSimulationOverRegularGrid): Instead of
    constructing a mesh and setting the initial condition, the setup reads a
    checkpoint written by exahype2.api.fv.WriteCheckpoint or
    exahype2.api.rkfd4.WriteCheckpoint and continues the simulation from
    there. It is available for both schemes as exahype2.api.fv.LoadCheckpoint
    and exahype2.api.rkfd4.LoadCheckpoint, as both use the same data layout.

    The setup consists of three phases:

    - It reconstructs the checkpoint's mesh. The refinement sweep repeats
      until the mesh is stationary and the load balancing has stagnated,
      exactly as for the regular grid. Instead of refining down to a given
      mesh size, it refines the parents of all cells in the checkpoint
      (@ref exahype2::CheckpointReader).
    - Once the mesh is complete, it switches off the load balancing and
      waits until the last splits have been carried out.
    - A last sweep loads the data. For every cell, it reads the patch with
      halo into the temporary solver._patch_with_halo, copies the patch into
      solver._patch and writes the patch with halo onto the overlaps of the
      faces (@ref toolbox.blockstructured.api.ProjectPatchWithHaloOntoFaces.ProjectPatchWithHaloOntoFaces).
      The faces hence also hold the ghost data along the domain boundary and
      the data at coarse-fine transitions as they have been at the time of
      the checkpoint. In unprepareTraversal(), the sweep restores the
      solver's time stamps, time step sizes and mesh sizes, plus the
      attributes the Python API has added, e.g. the time stamps of the next
      outputs of the plotters. Plotters which have written output at the
      time of the checkpoint move on to their next output, so the restarted
      simulation does not write them again
      (@ref exahype2.api.Solver.Solver._add_checkpoint_meta_data_to_solver()).

    The setup neither uses the initial condition nor the boundary conditions.
    The checkpoint has to be written by a solver with the same unknowns,
    auxiliary variables, patch size and halo, over the same domain. The code
    reads the checkpoint at runtime, i.e. the files have to exist when the
    simulation starts, but not when it is generated or built.

    The time stamps of all solvers have to match, i.e. a project with
    several solvers has to load checkpoints of all of them, written at the
    same time.
