# ADR 0001: Interpolation and restriction are combined with the tasks that use face data

Status: accepted (implementation in progress)
Date: 2026-11-09

## Context

All numerical schemes of `exahype2.api` (Finite Volumes, optimistic Finite Volumes,
Finite Differences with Runge-Kutta, and whatever follows) exchange data between
neighbouring patches through faces. On adaptive meshes, a face next to a coarser
neighbour is hanging: before anybody reads it, it has to be filled by interpolating the
coarse face data (`toolbox.blockstructured.api.InterpolateHangingFaces`). After
someone has written fine face data, it has to be restricted onto the coarse face
(`toolbox.blockstructured.api.RestrictHangingFaces`).
Interpolation and restriction as tasks of their own (as, for example, the
`Interpolate hanging faces stage k` tasks of the Runge-Kutta scheme) cost a mesh
traversal each, unless the task graph compiler happens to fuse them, and they
spread the knowledge on which faces are valid when over the schemes.

## Decision

**Interpolation and restriction never exist as stand-alone tasks.**

Whenever the action set of a task uses face data, the task also carries the
interpolate and restrict action sets for these face data:

- A task which reads face data (halo reconstruction, Riemann solve, ...) carries
  `InterpolateHangingFaces`, so the hanging faces are valid by the time the action set
  runs.
- A task which writes face data (projection of the solution onto the faces, ...) carries
  `RestrictHangingFaces`, so the coarse faces are up to date once the task has
  finished.

The rule applies to all numerical schemes, i.e. a scheme's task graph builder must not
add interpolation or restriction tasks. If a task needs the face data of several
data sets, it carries the action sets of all of them.

### Auxiliary variables

The rule holds for the unknowns and for the auxiliary variables, with a different
nuance, as auxiliary variables are not necessarily held by the faces:

- Whenever a task **reconstructs a patch** from auxiliary variables, it uses
  `InterpolateHangingFaces` for them. (Only sets that are flagged
  `to_be_interpolated` have faces in the first place.)
- Whenever a task **writes to a patch** of auxiliary variables, it uses
  `RestrictHangingFaces` for them, if and only if the auxiliary data are also held by
  the faces. Auxiliary variables without face data need no restriction.

## Consequences

- The Runge-Kutta stage tasks `Interpolate hanging faces stage k` and
  `Restrict ... on hanging faces`, the interpolation task in
  `AuxiliaryVariables.add_auxiliary_reconstruction_tasks()` and the corresponding
  tasks of the FV scheme are folded into the reconstruction and projection tasks.
  Task graphs get shorter, and dependencies between interpolation and reconstruction
  vanish.
- The interpolation scheme and the restriction scheme remain attributes of the
  numerical scheme and are handed to the action sets of the tasks.
- A new scheme or task using face data does not decide on its own how hanging faces are
  treated: it follows the rule. Reviewers can check the rule by looking for tasks that
  hold nothing but an interpolate or restrict action set.
