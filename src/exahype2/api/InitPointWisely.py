class InitPointWisely(PDETerm):
    """!

    Point-wise initial condition: given the physical position of a single
    degree of freedom, write its initial Q there.

    Unlike the legacy, cell-wise initialCondition() (handed a whole mesh
    cell's centre and extent plus gridIsConstructed, and expected to fill an
    entire patch itself - see python/exahype2/solvers/rkfd/*.template.h),
    this term is evaluated once per degree of freedom, exactly like Flux and
    MaxEigenvalue are:

    @code
    virtual void initPointWisely(
      const tarch::la::Vector<Dimensions, double>& x,
      double* __restrict__                         Q // Q[{{NUMBER_OF_UNKNOWNS}}+{{NUMBER_OF_AUXILIARY_VARIABLES}}]
    );
    @endcode

    Q holds the unknowns. If the solver has auxiliary variables, a pointer to
    each set follows right behind Q (@ref exahype2.api.AuxiliaryVariables).
    The solver that owns a set receives a non-const pointer and initialises the set
    here, as this term has to set up everything a fresh degree of freedom
    needs. Solvers which share a set receive a const pointer.

        implementation: str
          A C++ snippet that becomes initPointWisely()'s body (the empty
          string is a valid, generated no-op body, though a no-op initial
          condition leaves Q uninitialised), or None (the default) to leave
          initPointWisely() pure virtual for you to implement by hand.

          A grid construction such as exahype2.api.fv.SetupSimulationOverRegularGrid
          validates that the solver it is attached to has this term
          registered before it does anything else, since it relies on it to
          fill in the initial condition.

        InitPointWisely-specific code generation

        Declared explicitly (rather than left to be inherited implicitly)
        for the same reason as Flux.Generator: the obvious place to add
        initPointWisely-specific generation behaviour later, and so
        init_point_wisely_term.generator reports its type as
        InitPointWisely.Generator rather than the more generic
        PDETerm.Generator.
