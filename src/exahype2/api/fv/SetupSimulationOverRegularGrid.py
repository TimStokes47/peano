class SetupSimulationOverRegularGrid(Solver.GridConstruction):
    """!

    Setup phase counterpart to RusanovWithExplicitEuler: sets the initial
    condition for a Finite Volume scheme with a Rusanov Riemann solver,
    realised over a block-structured mesh, and prepares the data required
    for the first time step.

    Unlike SetupSimulationWithUserCodedRefinementCriterion, this variant
    does not refine the mesh at all: it assumes the mesh is already the
    regular grid it is going to stay, so setup only has to fill in the
    initial condition and project it onto the faces.

    The solver this is attached to has to have an exahype2.api.InitPointWisely
    PDE term registered (via solver.add_pde_term(...)), as that is what fills
    in the initial condition this class' setup task graph relies on;
    construct_output() asserts this before it builds anything.

    """

    ## Tag of the task which completes the setup over the initial regular mesh
    #
    # The setup constructs the regular mesh and then sets the initial
    # condition. The initial condition task carries this tag. After it, the
    # mesh and the solution are complete, but the solution has not yet been
    # projected onto the faces, as the projection is the very last task of the
    # setup. Subclasses which want to modify the mesh or the solution before
    # the time stepping starts search for the tag via
    # peano4.api.taskgraph.Graph.find_tasks() and insert their tasks after the
    # tagged one via peano4.api.taskgraph.Graph.insert_after(). The tasks
    # which have followed the tagged task so far, i.e. the projection, then
    # follow the inserted tasks (@ref exahype2.api.fv.SetupSimulationWithUserCodedRefinementCriterion).
