    Setup over a regular mesh which is then refined adaptively by the user's
    adaptivity criterion

    The setup does everything SetupSimulationOverRegularGrid does: It
    constructs a regular mesh and sets the initial condition. If the solver
    has an exahype2.api.AdaptivityCriterion PDE term, the setup then
    adapts this mesh. It inserts one further task after the task tagged with
    SetupSimulationOverRegularGrid.FinishedInitialRegularMeshSetup, i.e.
    after the initial condition. The projection onto the faces, which has
    followed the initial condition so far, follows this new task instead and
    hence remains the very last task of the setup.

    The new task repeats until the mesh is stationary. It hosts two action
    sets:

    - The action set which also evaluates the criterion within the time
      step (@ref exahype2.api.blockstructured.create_dynamic_mesh_refinement_action_set.create_dynamic_mesh_refinement_action_set())
      turns the criterion's outcome into refine or erase events for
      ExaHyPE's refinement service. Different to the time step, it also
      hands the service's events over to Peano.
      The mesh is never refined below min_volume_size.
      The setup vetoes all erase commands, i.e. it only ever refines the
      regular mesh: It has no restriction which would hand the patches of
      erased cells over to their parent. Erase commands of the criterion
      hence only take effect once the time stepping runs.
    - exahype2.api.fv.actionsets.InitialiseNewCells sets the initial
      condition within each cell which the refinement creates.

    Without an adaptivity criterion, the setup is the same as
    SetupSimulationOverRegularGrid.

    Peano realises a refinement event one to two mesh sweeps after the
    criterion has asked for it (@ref exahype2::RefinementControl). The mesh
    hence might still be stationary in the sweeps right after the criterion
    has issued an event. The task therefore repeats as long as the mesh
    changes or the refinement service still holds events.
