class PDETerm:
    """!

    Represents one named, point-wise PDE operator that a solver exposes for
    the user to implement: a C++ method name, its parameter list, and an
    implementation. flux(), eigenvalues(), the nonconservative product,
    algebraic/point sources, boundary conditions, ... all have this same
    shape (see python/exahype2/solvers/fv/riemann/kernels.py for how they
    are actually declared in the generated abstract solver header).

    Well-known terms should get their own PDETerm subclass which pins down
    name and signature and adds any term-specific behaviour - @see Flux for
    a fully worked example. Use the plain PDETerm constructor directly only
    for a new, solver-specific term that does not warrant its own subclass
    (yet).

    A term's implementation is a C++ code snippet that becomes the generated
    method's body verbatim - including the empty string, which generates a
    method that does nothing (a no-op, not "contributes zero": it does not
    zero out the output for you) - or None (the default), which leaves the
    method pure virtual for you to implement by hand in your solver
    subclass instead of generating it. A term you don't want at all is
    simply never passed to solver.add_pde_term() in the first place.

    implementation must not be None when stateless is True: the constructor
    raises ValueError in that case, since a stateless term's generated
    method is static, and static methods cannot be pure virtual - there
    would be no declaration left to signal "implement this by hand".

    PDETerm only models *what* the term is (name, signature, implementation).
    It deliberately knows nothing about Jinja2 or the code generator: turning
    a solver's collection of terms into the generated abstract solver header
    remains the code generator's job, exactly as it is today.
