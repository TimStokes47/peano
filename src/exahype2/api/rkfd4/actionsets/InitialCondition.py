    Fill a patch's initial condition, one grid cell at a time, by calling
    the solver's exahype2.api.InitPointWisely PDE term once per grid cell
    with that grid cell's centre.

    The Finite Differences of @ref exahype2.api.rkfd4 are cell-centred, i.e.
    each patch hosts patch_size^d grid cells and the unknowns are located at
    their centres. The action set is a copy of
    exahype2.api.fv.actionsets.InitialCondition, which places the unknowns
    in the very same way, as rkfd4 does not depend on the Finite Volume
    package.

    Checkpoint-restart support has deliberately not been ported: it relies
    on Solver attributes that do not exist in the new exahype2.api yet.
