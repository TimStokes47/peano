     * This is a "fake" enum, i.e. we do not use it to distinguish different
     * variants. Instead, we use it as a fix that allows us to "overload"
     * operations:
     *
     * In C++ you cannot overload w.r.t. static. We however need functions which
     * exist twice in ExaHyPE: Once as standard (virtual) member functions and
     * once at static version which an be offloaded to a GPU as it does not
     * have a state. Both function variants, in theory, have the same signature
     * but if they had, a compiler could not distinguish them. So I use this
     * enum for the GPU version.
     *
     * If you create a solver without GPU support, this enum will not be used.
     * It is however always created. Once you write a GPU version and then compile
     * without GPU support, you will thus still be able to have all your GPU
     * function variants, and you don't have to work with ifdefs.
