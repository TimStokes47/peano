     * with the TwoPunctures initial data of one non-spinning black hole
     * at rest. The puncture sits at the coordinate origin.
     *
     * TwoPunctures solves an elliptic problem before it can interpolate
     * anything. We do this once, upon the very first call, and keep the
     * solution in a function-local static object. C++ guarantees that
     * this initialisation is thread-safe, so you can call the routine from
     * concurrent tasks right from the start. All subsequent calls only
     * interpolate, i.e. read the TwoPunctures solution.
     *
     * The setup mirrors the legacy benchmark
     * @ref benchmarks_exahype2_ccz4_single_black_hole: TwoPunctures always
     * models two punctures at +/- par_b along the x-axis. We place them at
     * 0 and -2 by shifting the centre by -1, and give the second one zero
     * mass.
     *
     * We always use TwoPunctures' high-resolution interpolation, as we
     * evaluate the routine once per degree of freedom only, i.e. at
     * startup.
     *
     * @param Q    Output: the 59 CCZ4 unknowns at x.
     * @param x    Position. It should not coincide with the puncture, i.e.
     *             with the origin, where the data is singular.
     * @param t    Time stamp. Ignored, as the data is static initial data.
     * @param mass ADM mass of the black hole. All calls have to use the
     *             same mass, as the solution is computed only once.
