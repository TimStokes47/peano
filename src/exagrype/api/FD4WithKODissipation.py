    Fourth-order Finite Differences with Kreiss-Oliger dissipation

    The numerical scheme is exahype2.api.rkfd4.CentralDifferencesWithRungeKutta
    plus a Kreiss-Oliger dissipation of sixth order on top: Per Runge-Kutta
    stage, it first evaluates the plain fourth-order right-hand side and
    then adds

    @f$ \\frac{\\sigma}{64 \\Delta x_d} (Q_{i-3} - 6 Q_{i-2} + 15 Q_{i-1} - 20 Q_i + 15 Q_{i+1} - 6 Q_{i+2} + Q_{i+3}) @f$

    per axis d to the selected quantities (@ref
    exagrype.api.actionsets.AddKreissOligerDissipation). Both kernels read
    the same stage input, i.e. the outcome is the right-hand side with
    dissipation. The dissipation stencil reaches three grid cells into the
    neighbouring patches, so the scheme widens the halo from two to three
    grid cells. Everything else is inherited.

    To use the dissipation, replace the numerical scheme of a solver:

    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    solver.numerical_scheme  = exagrype.api.FD4WithKODissipation(solver, patch_size=9, rk_order=4, kreiss_oliger_sigma=8.0)
    solver.grid_construction = exahype2.api.rkfd4.SetupSimulationOverRegularGrid(solver, volume_size=0.04)
    solver.plotter           = exahype2.api.rkfd4.PlotAsVTKFile(solver, time_in_between_plots=0.1)
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    The grid construction and the plotter remain those of
    exahype2.api.rkfd4. The legacy ExaGRyPE runs used
    kreiss_oliger_sigma=8.0. The scheme is three-dimensional only, as it
    relies on exagrype::ccz4::addKreissOligerDissipation().

          The solver this numerical scheme realises.

          Number of grid cells per axis within one patch. Has to be at least
          HALO_SIZE=3.

        @param rk_order: int
          Order of the Runge-Kutta scheme, i.e. its number of stages.

        @param kreiss_oliger_sigma: float
          Scaling of the Kreiss-Oliger dissipation. Has to be non-negative.

        @param quantities: List[str or int] or None
          The unknowns which are subject to the dissipation. None, the
          default, selects all unknowns. A string is the name of an unknown
          as passed to the solver (e.g. "lapse" or "G" for exagrype.api.CCZ4Solver)
          and selects all of its entries. An int is the index of one entry
          of the unknowns. Auxiliary variables do not evolve in time and
          hence cannot be selected.

        @param time_step_size: float or None
          Fixed time step size. If None, the time step size is adaptive.

        @param cfl_constant: float
          CFL constant for adaptive time step sizes.

          The kernel which evaluates the right-hand side before the
          dissipation is added, @see
          exahype2.api.rkfd4.CentralDifferencesWithRungeKutta.

          Only for lopsided advection, @see
