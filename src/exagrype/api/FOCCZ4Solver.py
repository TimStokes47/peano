    Solver for the Einstein equations in the first-order CCZ4 formulation

    The solver is a plain exahype2.api.Solver with the 59 CCZ4 unknowns and
    the PDE terms of CCZ4 pre-registered. All terms delegate to the
    ExaGRyPE library (configure Peano with --enable-exagrype):

    - the non-conservative product to exagrype::ccz4::ncp(),
    - the volumetric source to exagrype::ccz4::source(),
    - the maximum eigenvalue to exagrype::ccz4::maxEigenvalue(),
    - the initial condition to one of the routines from
      exagrype::initialvalues, @see exagrype.api.initialvalues.

    CCZ4 has no conservative flux. You still have to assign a numerical
    scheme, a grid construction and (optionally) a plotter, exactly as for
    any other exahype2.api.Solver, and to add the solver to an
    exahype2.api.Project. The project has to be three-dimensional: the
    generated solver class refuses to compile otherwise.

    ## Shortcomings

    - The fourth-order Finite Differences of the production runs are
      available through exahype2.api.rkfd4, i.e. pass a
      CentralDifferencesWithRungeKutta as numerical scheme. They have no
      artificial dissipation. exagrype.api.FD4WithKODissipation is the same
      scheme with a Kreiss-Oliger dissipation on top. Unlike the legacy
      ExaGRyPE, neither supports adaptive mesh refinement yet.
    - The solution is pushed back onto the CCZ4 constraints
      (exagrype::ccz4::enforceCCZ4constraints()) only if you switch it on
      via enforce_ccz4_constraint(). Without it, long runs drift away from
      the constraint surface.
    - exagrype::ccz4::ncp() omits the advection terms
      @f$ \\beta^k \\partial _k Q @f$ of all unknowns besides the metric,
      the lapse, the shift and phi (whose advection is part of the
      algebraic source) and K0. It expects the numerical scheme to add them
      with lopsided stencils. The fourth-order Finite Differences do so if
      you select the kernel CentralDifferencesWithLopsidedAdvection with
      ADVECTION_VELOCITY and lopsided_advection_quantities(). The Finite
      Volumes of exahype2.api.fv do not add them, i.e. they evolve CCZ4
      without these advection terms.
    - The second-order formulation, black holes (TwoPunctures), tracers and
      the ADM/Psi4 postprocessing are not available yet.
