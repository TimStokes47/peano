    Restrict the overlap data of hanging faces onto the coarser mesh

    A hanging face is a face of a fine cell which sits on the face of a
    coarser, unrefined cell (toolbox.blockstructured.api.InterpolateHangingFaces).
    The action set plugs into destroyHangingFace(): It takes the half of the
    hanging face which belongs to the fine cell and restricts it onto the
    corresponding half of the coarse face
    (::toolbox::blockstructured::restrictInnerHalfOfHaloLayer_AoS_...).
    Peano destroys a hanging face after touchCellLastTime() of its fine
    cell, i.e. after the fine cell has projected its data onto its faces.
    Peano touches the coarse face for the last time after all of these
    hanging faces have been destroyed. Afterwards, the coarse face holds the
    data of the coarse cell on one side and the restricted fine data on the
    other side.

    The face overlap has to be a 2MxNxN patch: M is the overlap, N the
    number of volumes per patch axis.


    ## Averaging and clearing

    Averaging accumulates the fine grid values within the coarse face.
    The action set therefore clears the face data in touchFaceFirstTime()
    for each face which passes the clear guard. This clears both halves of
    the face. Use the action set only in a mesh sweep where all face data
    which are cleared are written again afterwards, e.g. by a projection
    onto the faces. Injection overwrites the coarse values and hence does
    not clear anything.
