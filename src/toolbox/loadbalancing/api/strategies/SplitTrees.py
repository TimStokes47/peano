    Split a tree using a staged load-balancing workflow.

    Stages:

    3. _optimize_hierarchy() (optional): Further reduce split complexity by
       promoting complete child sets up the hierarchy.
     4. create_constructor_initialisation_string() (optional): Derive full
         hardcoded constructor configuration from the transformed tree.

    Args:
        peano_tree: Tree to split (modified in place).
        number_of_subtrees: Total number of subtrees to create.
        traversal: Stage I traversal strategy. Supported values:
            - "bfs": level-order leaf collection
            - "bfs_finest_first": level-order leaf collection within each level,
              but levels processed from finest to coarsest
            - "dfs": depth-first leaf collection
        enable_propagate_bottom_up: If True, enable Stage II bottom-up subtree
            propagation after leaf redecomposition.
        enable_optimize_hierarchy: If True, enable Stage III hierarchical
            optimisation to minimise split operations through hierarchy lifting.
        require_all_children_for_hierarchy_optimization: Stage III guard for
            parent promotion. If True (default), a parent is only considered if
            all 3^d children exist. If False, Stage III may also promote mixed
            parents with partial child sets.
        enable_extract_split_instructions: If True, run Stage IV and return the
            derived `(hardcoded_config, hardcoded_mode)`.
        destination_ranks: Optional destination rank list for Stage IV. If not
            provided, it defaults to target subtree IDs.
        verbose: If True, Stage IV prints extracted hardcoded parameters.
        
    Notes:
        - All stages after Stage I are optional.
        - The tree is modified in place by the enabled transformation stages.
        - If number_of_subtrees <= 1, no transformation stage runs.
        - Stage III requires Stage II to have been applied first for correctness.
        
        
    @todo Dmitry We have to update the docu once we have converged the codes. 
                 So this can wait, but it remains a todo. Also, there has to
                 be a different way to split up the leaves:
                 
    @todo Dmitry At the moment, I do not see how you determine how many cells
                 you assign to each tree? I assume there's a helper somewhere.
                 I'm not sure if we also want to have splittings, where we can
                 configure the min number of cells per tree. Not sure how to 
                 best inject that, i.e. will need your advise.

    Stage I: BFS-style leaf redecomposition over Peano SFC order.

    This strategy runs through the mesh level by level. It first assigns all
    leaves on the finest level to partitions, then the leaves on the next
    coarser level, and so forth. Within each level, cells are visited in
    Peano space-filling-curve order, so the redecomposition follows the same
    ordering as the SFC traversal used elsewhere in the load-balancing API.

    @image html PeanoSFC.png

    The goal is to keep the finest-mesh cells contiguous while respecting the
    hierarchical tree structure. In practice, that makes the routine well
    suited for solvers that spend most of their work on the finest cells, such
    as limiter-based or multigrid-style workflows.

    The lexicographic order that used to be documented here now lives in
    `strategies/Lexicographic.py`; this function intentionally uses Peano SFC
    order instead.
    
    Leaf definition:
    - Any existing cell on the finest level, or
    - Any existing coarser-level cell with no children on the next level.

    Args:
        peano_tree: Tree to update (modified in place).
        number_of_subtrees: Total number of subtrees to create.
        finest_level_first: If `False` (default), process levels from coarsest
            to finest (`0..max_level-1`). If `True`, process levels from finest
            to coarsest while keeping BFS order inside each level.

    Returns:
        A tuple `(has_leaves_to_split, moved_nodes_per_subtree)`:
        - `has_leaves_to_split`: `False` if no eligible leaves were found.
        - `moved_nodes_per_subtree`: Per-subtree counts of reassigned leaves.

    Notes:
        - Only leaves in subtree 0 are redistributed.
        - Node existence flags (`weight`) are preserved.
        - This stage does not update non-leaf assignments.

    For each existing non-leaf node, if all existing children belong to the same
    subtree, assign the parent to that subtree.
    
    ## Implementation

    We work from finest to the coarsest level. On each level, we trigger an 
    iterative process (while loop) for each colour (tree number) `k` that we 
    find:
    
    ### Check if all kids of one cell belong to the same tree
    
    For a cell on level `level`, we run over all 3^d children (counter `child_a`
    and `child_b`). There is a set, and we add all the child tree numbers to this
    set. Once we have visited all children, we can check the set cardinality:
    If the set cardinality equals 1, all children are assigned to the same 
    tree. We therefore can assign the parent to this tree number, too.
    
    ### Make decision if to assign the parent
    
    If all kids belong to the same tree, we can propagate this ownership one
    level up. However, we do this for a tree `k` if and only if the following 
    tests pass:
    
    There could be multiple nodes `k` within the tree that span all together a
    forest of small trees. Let `max_k` be the maximum level of these root nodes
    within the forest, and let `min_k` be the minimum level.
    
    We assign an arbitrary node from another tree colour
    the colour `k` if and only if

    - `max_k - min_k` becomes smaller through the assignment, or;
    - `max_k - min_k = 0` and we could group all root nodes of `k` into 
      k/3^d coarser nodes.
    
    ###  Rationale
    
    The reason is that we don't want to propagate too aggressively bottom-up.
    Eventually, our goal is to introduce a hierarchy over the trees. For this,
    it helps us if all the root nodes of tree `k` are on the same level. In this
    case, we can determine (likely) one parent `k' and then tell `k' to fork x 
    times where x is the number of roots within the forest of `k`.
    
    Therefore, we try to ensure that `max_k - min_k` becomes smaller and smaller.
    This implies that, in an adaptive mesh, we try to group all the fine mesh
    parts together first.
    
    Eventually, all root nodes of the forest `k` will end up on the one and same
    level. It could now be that we could move all of them one level up. This
    is covered by the second case distinction.

    @todo Dmitry the check above is not implemented yet an causes the algorithm
                 to fail later on

    Stage III of the staged load-balancing workflow.

        Minimise the total number of split operations whilst preserving load balance
        established by Stage II. The algorithm lifts split decisions up the tree hierarchy
        by promoting a parent on level L-1 to the dominant subtree among its children
        on level L.

        Hierarchy lifting is applicable when:
        - All children of a parent exist (count equals 3^d, where d is the spatial
            dimensions count: d=2 -> 9 children, d=3 -> 27 children)
        - Children are mixed across at least two subtrees
        - A dominant child subtree M exists (largest child count)
        - The dominant subtree differs from the current parent subtree and yields a
            reduction of lower-level split pressure

        When these conditions are met, the parent is reassigned to the dominant subtree.
        Remaining child subtrees stay on level L, but their source parent subtree is now
        the updated one (which effectively moves part of splitting upwards).

    The algorithm operates bottom-up from finest to coarsest level(s), iteratively
    lifting applicable promotions until no further reductions are possible.

    Args:
        peano_tree: Tree to update (modified in place).
        Required precondition: Stage II (bottom-up propagation) must have been
        applied first to ensure non-leaf subtree consistency.
        require_all_children: If True (default), only promote parents whose
        full 3^d child set exists. If False, also allow promotions for mixed
        partial child sets.

    Returns:
        None.

    Notes:
        - This function is intended to run after `_propagate_bottom_up()`.
        - Preserves node existence flags (`weight`).
        - Modifies only subtree assignments to reduce split operation count.
        - Multi-pass iteration allows cascading promotions up the tree.
        - The "all children in one subtree" case is already resolved by Stage II;

    Reset all tree nodes to belong to subtree 0, effectively erasing all splitting.
    
    ## Use Cases
    
    - **Algorithm Testing**: Reset to known state between experiments
    - **Re-splitting**: Clear previous decomposition before applying new strategy
    - **Debugging**: Return to simple single-subtree configuration
    
    ## Implementation Details
    
    - Preserves all node weights (existence flags)
    - Only modifies subtree assignments (sets all to 0)
    - Updates tree metadata (subtree_count, split_pattern) consistently
    
    Args:
        peano_tree: Tree object to reset
        
    Returns:
        Modified Tree object with all nodes assigned to subtree 0
        
    Note:
        This operation is irreversible - previous subtree assignments are lost.
        Consider generating YAML backup before reset if preservation is needed.

    Stage IV of the staged load-balancing workflow.

    Derive the enumerated splits for Peano's hardcoded load balancer from a split tree.

    The function scans the tree arrays and reconstructs a sequence of splits
    which replays the observed decomposition with
    toolbox::loadbalancing::strategies::Hardcoded. Entry k of each returned
    list describes the kth split. The C++ strategy decides itself when to
    issue the kth split, i.e. there is no notion of mesh sweeps here.

    A split is emitted whenever, on some level, a cell with `subtree_id > 0` exists
    whose parent exists and has a different subtree id (i.e. the subtree gets introduced
    across a parent–child edge). Level 0 has no parent; any cells with `subtree_id > 0`
    on level 0 are treated as introduced from subtree 0.

    **BottomUp vs AggressiveTopDown extraction**

    The level at which a split is emitted depends on how many distinct introduction
    levels the subtree has:

    - *AggressiveTopDown* (single introduction level): a split is emitted at that one
      level.
    - *BottomUp* (multiple introduction levels): the subtree's forest of root cells does
      not all reside on the same level. In BottomUp mode, Peano propagates the split
      upward from the finest level automatically, so there must be no split instruction
      higher up the tree. A **single** split is therefore emitted at the **finest**
      introduction level (the deepest level at which any root cell of the subtree
      borders a parent of a different subtree). Coarser introduction levels are
      suppressed.

    The splits are ordered from coarse to fine emission level and, within a level,
    by subtree id.

    Mapping:
    - `splittingTrees` is the unique parent subtree id for all introduced cells on the
      emitted level, or 0 if ambiguous.
    - `numberOfCells` is the count of introduced cells on the emitted level.
    - `subTrees` are subtree ids (not MPI ranks); map them to destination ranks
      separately.
    - `bottomUpFlags` is a per-split boolean that is `True` when the corresponding
      subtree has multiple introduction levels (BottomUp) and `False` otherwise
      (AggressiveTopDown).

    Args:
        peano_tree: Input tree with subtree assignments.

    Returns:
        Tuple `(splittingTrees, numberOfCells, subTrees, bottomUpFlags)`
        suitable for building a `Hardcoded` configuration.

    Note:
        This helper is intended for *offline replay* of an already-computed split pattern.
        It does not modify the tree.
