        An algorithmic step for one particle can depend on different
        pre-conditions:

        - It can only depend on its own previous step (SELF);
        - It can depend on the neighbours within a particle's interaction radius
          (NEIGHBOURS);

        What happens in this algorithmic step per particle:

        - ALTER_GLOBAL_STATE is the most generic baseline routine. No local data
          are changed, but the code (might) alter some global properties. Typical
          examples are the reduction of the global admissible time step size.
        - ALTER_LOCAL_STATE implies that only the local state of a particle is
          changed. The code might also modify the global state, but it may not
          change a particle's position or its search radius, i.e. the spatial
          topology between particles.
        - CHANGE_POSITION_OR_INTERACTION_RADIUS is the most general update which
          means that literally any global or local attribute might be modified.
          However, the graph compilers have to know whether you might ask it to
          rerun this step. This is important, as this step might change the
          topology.

        Please note that any update of a particle position should happen within
        touch vertex last time. Otherwise, we'd destroy the particle topology.

        By default, any algorithm step runs only once. However, there are
        variants of each step which can rerun. But the user has to flag this
        possibility explicitly.

        The algorithmic step description is a meta data object, i.e. it only
        holds properties.

        ## Parameters/attributes

        @param cell_kernel: C++ code (string)
          Kernel invocation what happens in a cell. Set to None if nothing
          is to be done per cell.

        @param touch_vertex_first_time_kernel: C++ code (string)
          Kernel invocation what happens when we read a vertex and its particles
          for the first time. Set to None if nothing is to be done.

        @param touch_vertex_last_time_kernel: C++ code (string)
          Kernel invocation what happens when we read a vertex and its particles
          for the last time. Set to None if nothing is to be done.

        @param input_particles: ParticleSet
          Switch to None in most cases. This fragment gives you the opportunity
          to couple the particles of one step with another particle species. If
          you hand in None, then we assume that the algorithm step updates the
          particles as input function from the particles.

        @param includes: String
          Additional include statements

                   prepare_traversals_kernel        = None,

        @param prepare_traversal_kernel: String (C++ code snippet)
          Whenever Peano runs through the mesh, it creates one instance of the
          mesh observer and then runs through all subpartitions (trees) in
          parallel. Each replica of the observer issues its own touchVertexFirstTime(),
          touchCellLastTime(), ... events, and each replica starts its traversal
          with a call to beginTraversal() and endTraversal(). If you want to
          plug into the phase such before these parallel instances are created,
          you can use prepareTraversal() - the C++ code snippet passed to this
          attribute is copied into prepareTraversal(). The overview over
          @ref peano_action_sets "action sets" provides more details. Note that
          no action set (or observer object) is created at this point, i.e. the
          C++ code snippet will be injected into a static routine and can
          therefore only access static information. Often, this routine is used
          for some MPI communication (global data exchange), e.g., or to update
          some other static properties for whole sets of objects.

        @param unprepare_traversal_kernel: String (C++ code snippet)
          Counterpart of prepare_traversal_kernel. Consult
          @ref peano_action_sets "action sets" for more context.

        @param cell_kernel_dependency_policy: String or None
          If it is a string, it should identify one of the variants of
          exaparty::dependencychecks::Invariant. If you pick None, ExaParty
          will add default dependencies. They might be too strict.

        @param touch_vertex_first_time_dependency_policy: String or None
          If it is a string, it should identify one of the variants of
          exaparty::dependencychecks::Invariant. If you pick None, ExaParty
          will add default dependencies. They might be too strict.
