class Step:
    """!

    One step

    Most generic version of a solver step. A solverstep describes what Peano 4
    should do when it runs over the grid. As users have to specify which pieces
    of data from the data model are used by the solver step, it can handle all
    the user data stack flow.

    This class also is responsible to generate all function signatures of all
    the steps, observers and action sets. In the Peano terminology, a step
    corresponds to an observer. For any given step, we run through the mesh
    and pass the traversal automaton an observer which accepts events (aka
    state transition observations).

    It is the observer's job to then distribute these observations, broken
    down into grid actions such as "touch vertex first time", among the action
    sets that are tied to this observer. In Python you can have one action set
    and associate it with several observers. In the C++ code, we will flatten
    such a relation, i.e. create the corresponding action set multiple times.
