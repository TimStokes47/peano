class Particle(DaStGen2):
    """!

    Single particle

    Represent a single particle. This is a DaStGen2 wrapper, i.e. I
    define a DaStGen object and add some particular fields that I always
    need to administer the particles.


    ## Usage

    If you use these particles, please do not add them to your use
    definitions of the actions/observers. For pidt, you need a second
    ParticleSet and this one is used by the observers.

    You have to add the particle to your project though via

            my_project.add_global_object

    If you want to attributes to a particle, use the data subattribute.
    An all-time classic is the call

           add_attribute( peano4.api.dastgen2.Peano4DoubleArray("v","Dimensions") )

    ## Pre-defined fields

    I actually need only very few fields in Peano's particle toolbox:

    - A position x. You can change this position in your code, but please
      invoke a particle re-sort once you change a particle's position. Usually,
      I employ the pidt (particle in dual tree) scheme, i.e. particles are
      always stored in the closest vertex. If you alter the position of a
      particle, you might destroy this association and have to re-assign the
      object to another vertex.
    - A search radius. Every particle in Peano has a search radius, i.e. a maximal
      interaction radius. As I only compare particles stored in one vertex to
      particles stored in a cell-connected vertex, the search radius also
      implicitly determines the tree grid level that I use to hold a particle.
      The bigger the search, the higher up in the mesh I have to store a
      particle.
    - A state. This state should not be manipulated by the user. A tree owns the
      particles that are contained within its local tree cells. Furthermore,
      a tree knows about the particles which are associated to a vertex that's
      adjacent to a local mesh. The latter particles are virtual. We effectively
      work with a halo of h/2 per mesh level.

    The only action set that should alter the state is UpdateParallelState.

    ## State updates

    If a particle moves, we have to update its state, and we might have to
    update its vertex association. This discussion focuses on the state
    update.

    Details can be found in
      UpdateParallelState.

      
    ## Debug information
      
    If any debug level is active, each particle carries a unique identifier.
    
    
    ## Performance optimisation
    
    Particles in Peano are typically stored in the vertex next to them. This is 
    the pidt (paricle in dual tree) technique referenced in the Readme.md file 
    that's automatically generated when you use the particle toolbox.
    
    In the illustration below, the blue paricle is associated to the vertex 
    left above it, the red one belongs to the vertex right of it.

    The logical information where the "owning" vertex of a particle is is easy 
    to compute at any time from the geometric context. However, we found that 
    this recomputation is quickly becoming excessively expensive. Therefore, we
    add the field
    
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    self.data.add_attribute(
        dastgen2.attributes.BooleanArray("containedInAdjacentCell", "TwoPowerD", compress=True)
    )
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
    to the data model which encodes this information. It is to be set properly 
    by the particle sorting algorithm in use. 
    
    In the example above, the bitfield would hold 010 (read from right to 
    left) for the blue particle and 0100 for the red one. The code is read from
    the vertex's point of view: If we look at the centre vertex and study the 
    position of particle, it is not in the left bottom adjacent cell. It is 
    however in the right bottom adjacent cell. So we use a lexicographic 
    enumeration of the adjacent cells. 
    
    As the position of a particle within cells is not unique if a particle
    resides exactly on the face between two cells, the bitfield can hold
    more than one entry.
