### Data structure modelling

Peano models its data structures via a tool called DaStGen. The actual DaStGen 
version in use is the second generation of DaStGen which is integrated into 
LLVM, e.g. The first generation of DaStGen has been a stand-alone Java tool
which serves as a precompiler. As DaStGen 2 is not published yet, we appreciate 
a citation of the two original DaStGen papers when you discuss the memory needs:

Tailoring a code to require less memory is technical challenging, error-prone, and hardware-dependent. Object-oriented code typically consumes much memory, though developers favour such high-level languages offering meaningful models and good maintainability. We augment the language C++ with new keywords branding records to be memory-critical. Our precompiler DaStGen then transforms this augmented specification into plain C++ optimised for low memory requirements. Hereby, it encodes multiple attributes with fixed range within one variable, and it reduces the number of bits per floating point value. The tool also generates one user-defined MPI data type per class and, thus, facilitates the construction of parallel codes with small messages.}

    Construct a DaStGen2 object

    model is augmented with geometric debug information. Every Peano data

    Normally, we just hold all the aspects in a long list and generate them one

    Peano-specific one, we still want later to modify parts of it. That is, we 
    would have to run through all the aspects one by one, pick out the MPI and 
    storage one, and then alter this one. So what we do instead is that we hold
